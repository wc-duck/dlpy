# Data Library - python bindings

This is some old and unmaintained python-bindings for [datalibrary](https://github.com/wc-duck/datalibrary).

As I don't actively use them myself anymore I have no reason to fix all these issues with them , however just throwing them away seems wasteful so moving it to it's own repo 
seems like the best solution.
